            <h1>TEZPUR UNIVERSITY ENGINEERING CELL </h1>



            <p>

                Established in March 1995, the Engineering Cell of the University plays a pivotal role in ensuring the
                smooth functioning and continuous development of the campus infrastructure, which spans an expansive 262
                acres. This specialized department is entrusted with a multitude of responsibilities critical to the
                Universityâ€™s operations. Among its primary duties is the allocation and execution of a variety of
                construction projects, including those related to civil engineering, electrical systems, water supply
                networks, and sanitary installations. These projects are carefully planned and implemented to meet the
                growing needs of the campus community while adhering to safety and quality standards.
            </p>

            <p>

                In addition to new construction, the Engineering Cell takes charge of maintaining and repairing existing
                buildings, ensuring they remain functional and safe for students, faculty, and staff. Roads and pathways
                across the campus are regularly repaired and maintained to facilitate seamless mobility. The Cell is
                also responsible for the maintenance of power supply infrastructure, guaranteeing a stable and
                uninterrupted supply of electricity to all facilities within the University. Similarly, it oversees the
                provision of clean and adequate water to all campus buildings, including residential hostels, dining
                facilities such as canteens, and other essential areas.
            </p>

            <p>


                Beyond its technical and operational roles, the Engineering Cell also handles critical administrative
                functions. It prepares detailed agenda notes for meetings of the Building Committee, provides
                well-documented minutes, and offers insightful recommendations to guide decision-making on
                infrastructure-related matters. Furthermore, it is actively involved in the overall beautification,
                enhancement, and sustainable development of the campus environment. By addressing these wide-ranging
                responsibilities, the Engineering Cell ensures that the University continues to operate as a
                well-maintained, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing space, fostering an environment conducive to
                education, research, and community engagement.
